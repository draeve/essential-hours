        More Information on COVID-19:
    </h1>
    <p>
        COVID-19 has taken over 88,000 lives and infected almost 1.5 million people in the United States.
        To help those around us, it is important to do our part in slowing the spread of the virus. Remember to wash your
        hands, have good hygiene, and wear masks in public at all times. If you
        start to experience any symptoms such as shortness of breath, sore
        throat, or fever, be sure to call your local healthcare provider to find
        out if you should be tested.
